## Hi there, I'm Oscar 👋🏾

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Mechanical
Engineering at TU Berlin, with a specialization in
Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) and software
development.

Since I haven't been in the field of software development for too long I am still in the process of building up a portfolio.
